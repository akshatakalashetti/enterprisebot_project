Step 1: 

Scraping a web page
Scrape iPhone 12 link: https://www.amazon.in/Apple-New-iPhone-12-128GB/dp/B08L5TNJHG/
Scrape as many pages as possible and save all scraped data in the database. 
Scrapping Details:
 Review Title
 Review of Text
 Style Name(Storage size)
 Colour
 Verified Purchase 
Using scraped text, find out the best & worst keywords.


Step 2:
Sentiment Analysis:
Using the above-scraped data do sentiment analysis for it by using any existing python modules such as spacy, nltk, text blob, etc, or can create your own sentiment classifier as well. 


Step 3:
APIs:
There are two APIs :

Sentiment Analysis API:
o Given a new review call the API and get sentiment for it.

Review retrieval:
o  Using color, storage size, and rating fetch all the reviews.  








Thinking process,

There are 3 tasks and first two deals with python and third deals with establishing APIs
Best a way is to develop a Django application.
1st step utilize a database, so for simplicity, we can use sqlite database. 

Why Django?
It is a python based web framework.
establishing API will be easier.
Using python based libraries for scraping and sentiment analysis will be much easier.



Let start with making Django app.
1. Create virtual environment 
2. install Django
3. Create review_analyser project
4. create a new app reviewer
5.
